## About Me

<div style="overflow: hidden;">
  <img src="../images/me.jpg" alt="Ralph" class="about-img" style="float: left; width: 300px; margin: 0 20px 10px 0; border-radius: 8px;"/>

  I'm Ralph Gonzalvo, a software engineer based in Japan with experience building backend systems for fintech and aerospace. I enjoy designing reliable systems, writing clean code, and working across cultures and teams.  
  
  Originally from the Philippines, I moved to Japan in 2022 to study Japanese and later joined a Japanese company to work on drone traffic systems. Before that, I spent several years developing banking software used by global financial institutions.
  
  In my free time, I explore ideas, build tools and games, and try to keep things running (sometimes literally). I'm always learning â€” whether it's a new tech stack or just a better way to write things that (usually) work.
